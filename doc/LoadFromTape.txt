HOW TO LOAD KERNEL ONTO A CASSETTE TAPE:

NOTE: Even that it is possible to use the C64 Kernel with tape device, such as MP32C64, it is very slow and sometimes unreliable.

-Tested with VICE and real C64 (via MP32C64).

Recommended programs:
-VICE (https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io/index.html#download)
-DirMaster (https://style64.org/dirmaster)
-WAV-PRG (http://wav-prg.sourceforge.net/wavprg.html)
-Audiotap (http://wav-prg.sourceforge.net/audiotap.html)

Recommended hardware:
-Commodore 64 (Bread-bin or C64C)
-MP32C64 (eBay, if you are lucky)
-Headphone jack
-Audio device (MP3 player or cellphone)

1. Using DirMaster, you need to create T64 image files for each of the PRGs files that you want to load (this includes any SID or KLA files).
2. Use WAV-PRG with option to convert T64 file to TAP.
3. Under Output format, select "Fast" (aka Turbo Tape 64) and ensure that the Machine type is correct (PAL vs. NTSC).
4. Output to TAP and press OK.
5. Select "kernel.t64" first.
6. Output to "kernel.tap".
7. For the remaining T64 files, repeat steps 3-6 but instead select "Slow" for Output format and change the output name to be the same as the input files + ".tap".
8. Run Audiotap with the option to "Convert from TAP file" and "to a WAV file" and press OK
9. Select one of the TAP files created from steps 3-7 and save with the same name as the input + ".wav".
10. Repeat steps 8-9 for all of the TAG files.
11. Copy the WAV files to a device that is able to playback audio with a headphone jack (such as a cellphone).
	May need convert to a different audio format if WAV isn't supported by the device.
12. Connect the tape device to the C64 via the cassette port.
13. Connect the audio device to the tape device via the audio jack.
14. Power on the C64.
15. Press SHIFT+RUN/STOP
16. Press play on the device for "kernel.wav".
17. Hold down the space bar on the keyboard while it is loading. (You can release the spacebar once the screen starts flickering.)
18. At this point the file should have loaded*
19. You will need to play the next audio file when prompted (for example, after loading the logo, you will need to play "main.wav").
